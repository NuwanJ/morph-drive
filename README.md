# Origami Robot Algorithms

This Python package provides algorithms and tools for simulating and analyzing origami-inspired robotic systems. It is designed for researchers and developers working in robotics and related fields.

## Features

- Simulation of origami robot folding and motion, including integration with MuJoCo for physics-based simulations.
- Utilities for visualizing origami structures and their transformations.
- Pre-developed classes and environments for simulating and testing origami robots, both in virtual settings and with real robotic systems.

## Installation

```bash
pip install morph-drive
```
